    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      During the summer 2020, I had the opportunity to do a project with the
      guidance of the RedTree Web Design team. I built a full-stack task
      management application, focusing on both the design and development
      aspects of the project. There are 3 main elements to my project:
    </p>
    <ol class='list'>
      <li>Front end using React and Material UI.</li>
      <li>REST API using Express and Mongoose.</li>
      <li>MongoDB database.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
    <p>
      I used the MERN stack for this project, meaning that I used MongoDB,
      Express, React, and Node.js. I also used Adobe XD to work out my design.
      Netlify, Heroku, and MongoDB Atlas was used to host the web application,
      API, and database respectively (for free).
    </p>

    <h3>Timeline</h3>
    <p>May to August 2020 (3 months)</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      I began by discussing my ideas with the RedTree team, determining what it
      was I wanted to build and what should be included. From there, I spent 4
      weeks on design, creating both low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes
      under the guidance of the designer. I decided to use material design
      principles because of the availability of existing libraries. After that,
      I went into development using React. I used Material UI for styling. This
      was my first time working with React and I enjoyed learning a new
      framework.
    </p>

    <p>
      After making the basic frontend, I decided to work on a backend to add
      more functionality. I was able to create and host an API and database to
      allow interactivity with my hosted web app.

    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <ul class='list'>
      <li>Add sign up/sign in feature, separating tasks by user.</li>
      <li>Work on responsive design for tablet and desktop.</li>
      <li>
        Add features that I wanted to put in originally, like tags and
        reminders.
      </li>
    </ul>
