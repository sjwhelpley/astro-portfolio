    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      For my iXperience Full Stack Coding course, the final project was to
      create a functioning home-rental system replicating the main services of
      Airbnb. This was my first full stack project, as well as the first time I
      used Angular or built an API! I built 5 components for this project:
    </p>
    <ol class='list'>
      <li>
        Consumer mobile app - allows users to join, view listed properties, and
        create bookings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provider mobile app - allows users to join, create and update their
        rental property listings, and manage booking requests.
      </li>
      <li>
        Admin panel web app - allows admins to view all registered app users,
        listings and booking requests.
      </li>
      <li>
        REST API - for communication between the applications and database.
      </li>
      <li>
        MySQL database - for storing account information, listings, and
        bookings.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
    <p>
      The consumer and provider apps are build with Angular's Ionic framework,
      with Node.js for the backend. The admin panel is built with Angular. The
      API uses Express and connects to a MySQL database.
    </p>

    <h3>Timeline</h3>
    <p>July to August 2019 (~5 weeks)</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      On each app, users are first prompted to log in. Users of the Consumer and
      Provider apps are also able to register an account, but this is not a
      feature on the Admin panel for security purposes. All users are
      authenticated by the API using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Passwords are hashed
      using bcrypt.

    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>
      My future goals for this project would be to add to the design and
      features. I would love to create better branding and have all applications
      follow a unique, cohesive design. The grading of this project was on
      functionality alone, so I did not spend a lot of time on the UI/UX.
      Regarding features:
    </p>
    <ul class='list'>
      <li>
        On the consumer app, I would like to make the search bar functional so
        that once a lot of properties are added, users can find them by city or
        country. I would also like to allow users to edit or delete bookings.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the provider app, I would like to allow providers to add multiple
        image URLs. I already have the database set up with a listing-imageURL
        mapping table, so I just need to give the user multiple fields to add in
        links. I would like to try giving them the ability to add or subtract
        input fields as necessary!
      </li>
      <li>
        On the admin panel, I would like to try and add analytics or a summary
        on the Home page. I would also like to add the feature of an admin being
        able to delete accounts or reset passwords.
      </li>
    </ul>
