    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      During my study abroad trip with iXperience, I had the opportunity to
      complete an internship with a local business and complete a project with
      them that related to the work we were doing in class with full-stack
      coding. I chose to work with Nourish'd because I loved the idea of working
      with small establishment prioritizing purity and health, and getting the
      chance to learn more about e-commerce.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      I was on a team with 5 other students and we worked with the Marketing
      Manager and the founders. The goal with this project was to create a way
      for their customers to order juice cleanses through their Shopify store
      using a mobile app that better guided them through the process. When
      creating a juice cleanse, there are many options to consider and ways for
      customization. Their Shopify website alone did not have the capability to
      help customers in the necessary way.
    </p>

    <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
    <p>
      The cross-platform mobile app is build with Angular's Ionic framework. The
      backend uses Node.js to connect to the Shopify Storefront API, which uses
      GraphQL to pull data.
    </p>

    <h3>Timeline</h3>
    <p>July to September 2019 (~3 months)</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      At the end of the study abroad program, my team had accomplished building
      a working mobile app. Though not released, it had the functionality to
      allow customers to successfully order a cleanse with all the necessary
      details sent to the store.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      My major role in this project was becoming familiar with the Shopify API
      and connecting the frontend to the backend. At first, our team did not
      realize the availability of the Shopify API and how we could connect the
      store's exisitng information to our app (rather than creating a new API
      and database). So we spent some time researching options and determining
      how to implement the API calls into our app.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      Once we learned how it would work, 2 members of our team worked on the UI
      of the app, 2 members worked on the backend, and 1 worked on backend as
      well as using Cordova for mobile notifications. I went back and forth
      between frontend and backend, making sure everything was working properly
      and helping team members debug issues. I really liked being in this role
      because I was able to get a very holistic view of the project and came to
      understand all of its pieces very well.
