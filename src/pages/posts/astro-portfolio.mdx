When I created my first personal website a few years ago, I used plain HTML and CSS. It was a great learning experience for me, as I was able to learn a lot of concepts I hadn't used before, like CSS Grid and media queries. Though it helped my skills in those languages, I was well aware of the limitations of using them for a multi-page site with many similar elements across the pages (like the navbar and footer, for example). There are ways to reuse code 
(see [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/reusable-html-components-how-to-reuse-a-header-and-footer-on-a-website/)), but it still requires extensive JavaScript in a more complicated way.
It mirrors the ideas around React, without the convenience.

I had learned React near the end of my time in college, and I have used it daily since starting my career. Therefore, I knew I wanted to redo this website using React, or some other similar technology that would be useful to learn. 
Recently, I saw Una Kravets share on Twitter about her [new website using Astro.](https://una.im/) After looking into it, I thought it would be a great thing to use, especially for my small static site.

This is a quote from Astro's homepage:

> Astro optimizes your website like no other framework can. Leverage Astro's unique [zero-JS frontend architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) to unlock higher conversion rates with better SEO.

...Zero-JS? As a frontend developer, I found this a very interesting idea, though it makes sense - why include the overhead of JavaScript when it just isn't necessary? I wanted to build my portfolio using a modern technology, but I didn't need everything that's packaged up with say, a regular React app. All my content is manually added to the source code, so the only interactive JS I use (for now) is for my theme toggle.

At the same time, it does have the capability to add React support (among many other JS frameworks), which helps speed up development. But in the end, the browser mostly receives the HTML/CSS.

Astro is a static site generator (SSG), which means that pages are generated on the server before being passed to the browser. They are rendered at build-time, which makes it optimal for sites with static content. This is what makes it so great for SEO - search engines receive all your content already rendered in the HTML which can help drive up the site's ranking.
