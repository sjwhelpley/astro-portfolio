      <h1>Hi! Call me Sam.</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a 2021 graduate of the University of Pittsburgh where I studied
        Information Science. I currently work at VISIMO in Pittsburgh as a
        software developer, contributing to a variety of projects using React
        and building wireframes with Figma.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of my first web programming projects were completed when studying
        abroad during the summer of 2019, but I've also interned with two
        Pittsburgh web design agencies, <a

          href="https://www.responsival.com/">Responsival</a
        >
        and <a class="redtree" href="https://redtreewebdesign.com/"
          >RedTree Web Design</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about the design and development process and
        understanding the people behind technological solutions. My primary
        skills are in frontend development using React and React Native. At the
        same time, I am always improving my JavaScript and Python backend
        skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        I jumped around a number of majors during my years in college, from
        Mathematics to Sociology to Computer Science, but I was drawn to the
        versatility and innovation present in the Information Science program. I
        was able to focus on the areas of web design and development while also
        gaining exposure to other areas, like database management systems,
        networking, human factors, and requirements analysis. Combined with my
        minor in Computer Science and certificate in Digital Media, I have the
        tools to continually learn and create.

        ‚úàÔ∏è Originally from the Lake Erie shores in Ohio and current
        Pittsburgher, I love traveling to new places and discovering new things.
        I enjoy exploring National Parks (see my project <a
          href={`${url}/portfolio/explore`}>Explore National Parks</a
        >) and spent six weeks in South Africa the summer of 2019.

        üé∂ Outside of school and work, band is my pastime. I played piccolo in
        the Pitt Band all four years of college, but I have played flute for
        over ten years.
