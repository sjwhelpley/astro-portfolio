      <h1>Hi! Call me Sam.</h1>
      <p>
        I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 2021 with a degree in
        Information Science. Still located in Pittsburgh, I currently work at
        VISIMO as a software developer, contributing to a variety of projects
        using React and building wireframes with Figma.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of my first web programming projects were completed when studying
        abroad during the summer of 2019, but I also interned with two
        Pittsburgh web design agencies during college, <a

        and <a class="redtree" href="https://redtreewebdesign.com/"
          >RedTree Web Design</a
        >.

        I am passionate about the design and development process and
        understanding the people behind technological solutions. My primary
        skills are in frontend development using React and React Native. At the
        same time, I am always improving my backend skills, primarily with
        Python and Django.
      </p>
      <p>
        My strengths lie in determining and executing technical requirements
        based on user needs. Additionally, I am detail-oriented, which benefits
        my contributions to project planning and debugging. In my current
        position, I am the lead software developer, so I help manage budgets and
        determine the tasks and staffing across the variety of projects. I am
        also technical leads of individual projects, where I contribute to
        client communication, project management, and guiding the overall
        direction of the software side of the project. Depending on the project,
        I also interact with Data Scientists to translate technical requirements
        to aid with integrating the software with the AI/ML components.
      </p>

        Working on a small team with limited other frontend developers has
        showcased my ability to solve complex problems, and plan and execute
        internal initiatives for the benefit of the development process. When I
        first began working at VISIMO, we created our projects using Create
        React App, but in 2023, I took the opportunity to update the frontend
        project templates to use Vite. When one of our Army projects required
        unit test coverage, I lead the initiative to learn and implement testing
        on that project, and incrementally began adding it to other projects. I
        originally used Jest and Enzyme, but with the updated templates, I use
        Vitest and React Testing Library. Due to this work, we have added unit
        testing as a part of the development process whether there are external
        requirements or not. I was also the developer that first suggested using
        Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) instead of depending on native
        applications for offline-first projects. I now have strong knowledge of
        PWAs and use the Redux Offline package to create applications that work
        smoothly offline, which is a valuable selling point for many of our
        projects. I've worked on 3 PWAs in the past year.

        ✈ I love traveling to new places and discovering new things. I spent
        six weeks studying abroad in South Africa the summer of 2019, and have
        made sure to continue experiencing new cities and countries since!

        ♫ I love music! I played piccolo in the Pitt Band all four years of
        college, and have played flute for over ten years.
