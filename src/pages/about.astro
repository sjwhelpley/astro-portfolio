      <h1>Hi! Call me Sam.</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a 2021 graduate of the University of Pittsburgh where I studied
        Information Science. I currently work at VISIMO in Pittsburgh as a software
        developer, contributing to a variety of projects using React and Django. Some of
        my first projects were completed when studying abroad during the summer
        of 2019, but I've also interned with two Pittsburgh web design agencies, <a

        >
        and <a class='redtree' href='https://redtreewebdesign.com/'
          >RedTree Web Design</a
        >.

        I am passionate about the design and development process and
        understanding the people behind technological solutions. My primary
        skills are in frontend development using React and React Native. At the
        same time, I am always improving my JavaScript and Python backend
        skills.

        I jumped around a number of majors during my years in college, from
        Mathematics to Sociology to Computer Science, but I was drawn to the
        versatility and innovation present in Information Science. I was able to
        focus on the areas of web design and development through this program
        while also gaining exposure to other areas of tech, like database
        management systems and networks. Combined with my minor in Computer
        Science and certificate in Digital Media, I have the tools to
        continually learn and create.

        ‚úàÔ∏è Originally from the Lake Erie shores in Ohio and current
        Pittsburgher, I love traveling to new places and discovering new things.
        I enjoy exploring National Parks (see my project <a
          href={`${url}/portfolio/explore`}>Explore National Parks</a
        >) and spent six weeks in South Africa the summer of 2019. I'm grateful
        for any chance to travel and learn from the world!

        üé∂ Outside of school and work, band is my pastime. I played piccolo in
        the Pitt Band all four years of college, but I have played flute for
        over ten years. Music can create the strongest bonds and I have been
        lucky enough to experience that. I have learned true dedication and
        pride through those weekly practices and performances.
