      <h1>Hi! Call me Sam.</h1>
      <p>
        I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 2021 with a degree in
        Information Science. Still located in Pittsburgh, I currently work at
        VISIMO as a software developer, contributing to a variety of projects
        using React and building wireframes with Figma.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of my first web programming projects were completed when studying
        abroad during the summer of 2019, but I also interned with two
        Pittsburgh web design agencies during college, <a

          href="https://www.responsival.com/">Responsival</a
        >
        and <a class="redtree" href="https://redtreewebdesign.com/"
          >RedTree Web Design</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about the design and development process and
        understanding the people behind technological solutions. My primary
        skills are in frontend development using React and React Native. At the
        same time, I am always improving my backend skills, primarily with
        Python and Django.
      </p>
      <p>
        My strengths lie in determining and executing technical requirements
        based on user needs. Additionally, I am detail-oriented, which benefits
        my contributions to project planning and debugging. In my current
        position, I am the lead software developer, so I help manage budgets and
        determine the tasks and staffing across the variety of projects. I am
        also technical leads of indiivdual projects, where I contribute to
        client communication, project management, and overall guiding the
        direction of the software side of the project. Depending on the project,
        I also interact with Data Scientists to translate requirements in order
        to integrate the software with the AI/ML components.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working on a small team with limited other frontend developers has
        showcased my ability to solve complex problems, and plan and execute
        internal initiatives for the benefit of the development process. When I
        first began working at VISIMO, we created our projects using Create
        React App, but in 2023, I took the opportunity to update the frontend
        project templates to use Vite. When one of our Army projects required
        unit test coverage, I lead the initiative to learn and implement testing
        on that project, and incrementally add it to our other projects.
        Originally I used Jest, but now with Vite, we use Vitest. Due to this
        work, we have added unit testing as a part of the development process
        whether there are external requirements or not. I was also the developer
        that first suggested using Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) instead
        of depending on native applications for offline-first projects. I now
        have strong knowledge of PWAs and use the Redux Offline package to
        create applications that work smoothly offline, which is a valuable
        selling point for many of our projects - I've worked on 3 PWAs in the
        past year.

        ‚úàÔ∏è Originally from the Lake Erie shores in Ohio and current
        Pittsburgher, I love traveling to new places and discovering new things.
        I enjoy exploring National Parks (see my project <a
          href={`${url}/portfolio/explore`}>Explore National Parks</a
        >) and spent six weeks in South Africa the summer of 2019.

        üé∂ Outside of school and work, band is my pastime. I played piccolo in
        the Pitt Band all four years of college, but I have played flute for
        over ten years.
